ObjectLibrary serves as the Data Access Layer for TCGEpicor

Retrieve functions retrieve data through the use of SQL stored procedures

Create, Update and Delete functions operate through the Epicor business objects

All input and output from the ObjectLibrary is done through Objects defined in the relevant classes.  This is to provide intermediary data manipulation(formatting, transform, etc.)

For Vantage Bridge to work, MySql.Data.msi has to be installed
